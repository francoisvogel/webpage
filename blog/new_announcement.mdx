I'm proud to announce, that the new version of my webpage has been developed and is now online. I haven't migrated most contents from the old blog yet (and maybe I'll never do it cause I'm too lazy :p). (If ur curious the contents of the old version are still on GH but most of the features aren't working anymore!).
To build this new version I've used Gatsby together with React.
It's the first time I've use Tailwind CSS on a website, and I must say that I'm quite amazed. It's incredible how quickly you can edit all kinds of complex css features in one go.
Since T-CSS now supports it, I plan on adding a dark/light mode.
I'll also add commenting features and likes when I have more time.
