                    <p class="max-w-lg mt-10 sm:text-3xl text-xl text-center">I'm a student at Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris. I love programming ever since I started coding. Also, I like to play some Jazz and I'm a hobbyist drone pilot.</p>
                    <p class="mt-10 text-2xl sm:text-5xl text-center">Competitive Programming</p>
                    <p class="mt-10 text-base sm:text-xl text-center sm:w-2/3">I love the feeling that I get upon submitting problems I've been working on for hours and seeing if they're finally work. My favorite phrase is "Sleep, code, eat, repeat", I sometimes really follow this rule to the letter, though don't take it too seriously. I have a <Lnk to="https://github.com/francoisvogel/cp" text="Github Repo"/> where I post resources on CP, though for now it's mostly empty (I'm in the process of migrating resources to it). I'm a <Lnk to="https://codeforces.com/profile/fvogel" text="Candidate Master" /> on Codeforces and am highly rated on <Lnk to="http://www.france-ioi.org/algo/rankingMain.php#:~:text=621-,4,571,-5" text="France-IOI"/>. Also, I regularly write posts on CP in my blog.</p>
                    <p class="mt-10 text-2xl sm:text-5xl text-center">Drone Flying</p>
                    <p class="mb-10 mt-10 text-base sm:text-xl text-center sm:w-2/3">I'm a DJI drone pilot, skilled in cinematography and terrain mapping, and a hobbyist flyer. Flyings my drone with Goggles gives me immersive sensations that I feel nowhere else, it's absolutely unique! Please contact me if you need drone services.</p>
